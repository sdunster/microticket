# Bring the AWS-free local stack up *detached*, for scripts rather than people.
#
# `make dev-local` is the interactive form: it holds the terminal, streams three
# processes into it, and dies with Ctrl-C. That is the wrong shape for a browser
# test or a CI job, which needs the stack running in the background and a command
# that returns once it is actually answering.
#
#   up      start DynamoDB Local, create tables, then run the API and the web dev
#           server in the background; return once both answer.
#   down    stop the API and the web server. The database keeps running, and its
#           data with it — `make local-down` stops that separately.
#   status  report what is up.
#
# Seeding (`make local-seed`) is not part of `up`: it needs the entity types a
# later build step adds, and stays a separate, stubbed target until then. See
# CLAUDE.md's scope note on not reaching ahead of the current build step.
