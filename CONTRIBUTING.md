# Contributing

Contributions are welcome — bug fixes, improvements, or new features. Here's how to get involved.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Follow [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) to get the project running locally.
3. Make your changes.

> **Always branch from `main`.** It's the stable branch and its history is never rewritten. The
> `prod` branch deploys to production on push — don't base work on it. See
> [Branches & deployments](README.md#branches--deployments) for details.

## Before submitting a PR

Run the full check suite and make sure everything passes:

```
make check
make test
```

`make check` is the static half of CI (actionlint, Relay compilation, Prettier, ESLint,
TypeScript typecheck, a production web build, `terraform fmt`/`validate`, a Rust toolchain
version check, `cargo fmt`, GraphQL schema diffing, and Clippy) — **it runs no tests.**
`make test` runs the Rust and web test suites. CI runs both, so it's worth catching issues
locally first.

If it fails on formatting, fix it with:

```
make format
```

If you've changed the GraphQL API, regenerate the schema file before running `make check`:

```
cd api && cargo run --locked --bin export-schema > schema.graphql
cd web && npm run relay
```

> `make check` needs `actionlint` (`brew install actionlint`) and Terraform on your PATH.

## Opening a pull request

- **One commit per PR.** Squash your branch down to a single commit before opening the PR (or
  before merge, if review feedback added fixup commits along the way).
- **Keep PRs small and focused** — one logical change per commit/PR makes review easier. For
  larger work, prefer a stack of small PRs that build on each other over one large PR.
- **Every PR/commit must be safe to deploy on its own.** It must pass CI (`make check` &&
  `make test`) and stand correctly by itself — don't leave a PR in a half-working state that only
  becomes correct once a later PR in the stack lands. If a change genuinely can't be split into
  independently-deployable steps, that's a signal to reconsider the approach before opening the PR.
- Write a clear commit message / PR description explaining what the change does and why.
- If the change is non-trivial, include a short note on how you tested it.

There's no formal issue requirement for small fixes, but for larger changes it's worth opening an
issue first to discuss the approach.

## Code style

- Rust: formatted with `cargo fmt`, linted with `cargo clippy`.
- TypeScript/JS: formatted with Prettier, linted with ESLint (`npm run lint`).

Both are enforced by `make check`.
