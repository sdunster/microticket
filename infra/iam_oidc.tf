# GitHub Actions OIDC deploy role. CI assumes this via web identity
# federation — no long-lived access keys stored anywhere. Scoped to exactly
# what deploy-prod.yml needs: update the two lambdas' code, sync the web
# bucket, invalidate CloudFront.
#
# No iam:PassRole (cargo lambda deploy never passes a role — the functions
# already have theirs, Terraform-managed in iam.tf) and no
# lambda:CreateFunction (Terraform, applied by hand, owns creation; CI only
# ever updates an existing function's code).

  # Tighter than the seslogin pattern this was copied from: the sub
  # condition pins to a push landing ON the prod branch specifically
  # (`ref:refs/heads/prod`), not `repo:...:*`. A PR against prod, a tag, or
  # any other branch cannot assume this role — only deploy-prod.yml's own
  # trigger can.
  #
  # Two accepted subjects, because GitHub issues the claim in two shapes and
  # which one you get is a repository setting, not something the workflow
  # controls:
  #
  #   repo:owner/name:ref:refs/heads/prod                    (name-based)
  #   repo:owner@<owner_id>/name@<repo_id>:ref:refs/heads/prod  (immutable)
  #
  # The immutable form embeds GitHub's numeric owner and repository ids, so
  # trust does not survive a repo being deleted and recreated under the same
  # name — strictly better, and worth preferring where available. StringEquals
  # against a list matches if ANY element matches, so listing both keeps the
  # deploy working whichever shape the repo is configured to emit, without
  # resorting to a wildcard that would widen what can assume this role.
