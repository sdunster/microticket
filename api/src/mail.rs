//! Outgoing-email abstraction.
//!
//! Mirrors the [`crate::db`] / [`crate::dynamodb`] / [`crate::mockdb`] split: this
//! module holds the trait, [`crate::sesmail`] sends via AWS SES, and
//! [`crate::mockmail`] logs the message instead, so the API can run — including the
//! email-code login flow (`requestAuthCode`) — with no AWS account.
//!
//! `send_plain_text`/`send_html` cover the auth flow's simple mail. `send_raw`
//! (step 6) is for ticket mail: a fully-built RFC 5322 message from
//! [`crate::outbound`], sent with explicit envelope recipients so threading
//! headers, `Reply-To`, and attachments (step 7) are under this project's
//! control rather than SES's "simple" template. It returns the provider's
//! message id in the exact form later threading needs to look it back up —
//! see [`crate::sesmail`]'s doc comment for what that form is and why.
