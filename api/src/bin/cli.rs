//! microticket `cli` — a thin, ergonomic wrapper over the DB API, following
//! seslogin's `bin/cli.rs` conventions (one subcommand tree per object type,
//! writes happen immediately, `--dry-run` reports what *would* change
//! instead). This is how an operator bootstraps the first organisation and
//! its first owner — see `DEVELOPMENT.md`'s "Bootstrapping the first
//! organisation" section for the sequence this drives.
//!
//! Unlike `bin/local-tables.rs`/`bin/local-seed.rs`, this CLI is **not**
//! restricted to a local DynamoDB endpoint — it is the general admin tool,
//! meant to run against a real deployed `DB_PREFIX` too.
